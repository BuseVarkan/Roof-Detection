# Roof-Detection

There are 30 satellite pictures of houses and 25 corresponding labels that indicate the roofs. I took those 25 data points and trained a neural network on them. The preferred language is Python. I evaluated the network on the 5 remaining test images by making predictions of the roofs. The data can be found at https://dida.do/downloads/dida-test-task.
